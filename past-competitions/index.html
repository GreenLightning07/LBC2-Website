            <h2>2020 LBC2</h2>
            <p>The third Loyola Blakefield Cyber Challenge took place on March 7, 2020, at Loyola Blakefield High School in Towson, Maryland. The challenge was created entirely by students, led that year by Henry Mackay and William Erdman. It was a rousing success, with over a hundred people in attendance. There were many industry mentors on hand as well, in order to make it a true day of teaching and learning.</p>
            <p>The third annual edition of LBC2 also included a Workforce Summit for parents, industry partners, guidance counselors, educators, friends and family of competitors. The summit was inspired by the Governor’s Workforce Development Board (GWDB) and highlighted the private and public sector’s need in all types of businesses for future employees capable of defending against complicated cyber threats. The Workforce Summit aimed to build a better relationship between students, educators, and employers to provide students the skills to make a positive impact on the future. </p>
